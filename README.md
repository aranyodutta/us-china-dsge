# US–China DSGE (Two-Country New Keynesian Model)

This repository contains a two-country DSGE model (United States and China) developed for research on dollar dominance and de-dollarization.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (e.g., R2023b)
- Dynare 5.x installed and on the MATLAB path

## Quick start
1. Open MATLAB
2. `cd code/scripts`
3. Run `run_all.m`
4. IRFs will be exported to `figs/`

## Repository layout
- `code/` — Dynare `.mod` files, steady-state, helper scripts
- `data/` — small CSVs or links (no large raw files committed)
- `docs/` — scope notes, equations, methods
- `figs/` — exported IRFs, plots, and tables
- `paper/` — draft text and tables for the write-up

## Notes
- Scope document defines milestones and deliverables.
- All code/data here is integrated and maintained by Aranyo Dutta.
