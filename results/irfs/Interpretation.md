# How to Read and Interpret the IRF Analysis

This section explains the **logic, structure, and reading strategy** used to analyze the impulse response functions (IRFs) in this paper. The goal is to provide a clear roadmap for understanding how shocks propagate through the model and how economic mechanisms are identified.

---

## 1. General Interpretation Strategy

Impulse response functions trace the dynamic response of endogenous variables to an exogenous shock, holding all other shocks constant. Each IRF should be interpreted as a **causal transmission mechanism** implied by the model’s structure.

Throughout the analysis, IRFs are interpreted by following a consistent sequence:
1. **Shock definition**
2. **Direct policy or structural response**
3. **Domestic macroeconomic transmission**
4. **International spillovers**
5. **Persistence and convergence**

This disciplined approach ensures internal consistency and economic clarity.

## 2. Step 1: Identify the Shock

Each IRF analysis begins by clearly identifying:
- The **source of the shock** (e.g., US monetary policy shock, China dollarization shock)
- The **sign of the shock** (positive or negative)
- The **institution or mechanism affected directly**

Examples:
- A **US monetary policy shock** directly affects the Federal Reserve’s policy rate.
- A **China dollarization shock** directly alters the effectiveness of monetary transmission in China through the policy rule.

---

## 3. Step 2: Direct Policy Response

The next step is to analyze the **immediate response of the policy instrument**:
- Policy interest rates respond mechanically through Taylor-type rules.
- Interest rate smoothing explains gradual adjustment and persistence.

This step establishes the **anchor** of the IRF analysis:
- If the policy rate response is not understood, subsequent responses cannot be correctly interpreted.

---

## 4. Step 3: Domestic Transmission Mechanism

Once the policy rate response is established, the analysis proceeds to domestic macroeconomic variables:

### Key Channels
- **Interest rate channel:** affects consumption and investment
- **Aggregate demand channel:** influences output gaps
- **Cost channel:** affects marginal costs and inflation via the Phillips curve

Typical sequence:
1. Policy rate → demand conditions
2. Demand → marginal costs
3. Marginal costs → inflation

The signs and timing of these responses must be consistent with New Keynesian theory.

---

## 5. Step 4: International Spillovers

Given the two-country structure, shocks propagate across borders through:
- Trade linkages
- Terms of trade
- Exchange rate movements
- Monetary policy spillovers

For example:
- US monetary tightening affects China through exchange rates and policy reactions.
- Dollarization shocks in China spill over to the US via interest rates and inflation dynamics.

This step highlights the **global nature of monetary transmission**.

---

## 6. Step 5: Role of Dollarization

A central contribution of the model is the role of **financial dollarization** in shaping monetary policy effectiveness.

When dollarization increases:
- Domestic monetary policy becomes less effective
- Inflation becomes less responsive to interest rate changes
- Central banks must react more aggressively

When dollarization decreases (de-dollarization):
- Monetary transmission strengthens
- Smaller policy adjustments are sufficient
- Macroeconomic stabilization improves

IRFs are interpreted with this mechanism explicitly in mind.

## 7. Step 6: Timing, Persistence, and Magnitudes

After establishing direction and channels, attention turns to:
- **Timing:** How quickly variables respond
- **Persistence:** How long effects last (number of quarters)
- **Speed of convergence:** Return to steady state

Persistence is driven by:
- Interest rate smoothing
- Nominal rigidities
- Shock autoregression

---

## 8. Interpreting Positive vs. Negative Responses

- A **positive response** indicates movement in the same direction as the shock.
- A **negative response** indicates a counteracting adjustment.
- No response or weak response suggests:
  - Offset by policy reactions
  - Weak transmission channels
  - Model-implied neutrality

Statistical insignificance is interpreted cautiously and reported explicitly.

---

## 9. Consistency Across IRFs

All IRFs are interpreted using:
- The same variable ordering
- The same economic logic
- The same time horizon

This consistency allows:
- Comparisons across shocks
- Clear identification of mechanisms
- Transparent interpretation for replication

---

## 10. Summary Reading Logic

To read the IRFs correctly:
1. Start with the **shock**
2. Follow the **policy response**
3. Trace **domestic macro effects**
4. Examine **international spillovers**
5. Evaluate **persistence and stabilization**

This structured approach ensures that the IRF analysis reflects the underlying DSGE model logic rather than isolated graphical movements.

## Final Remark

The IRF analysis is not a collection of disconnected figures, but a coherent narrative describing how monetary policy and dollarization jointly shape macroeconomic dynamics in an interconnected global economy.
