# Variable and Parameter Glossary

This section provides a comprehensive glossary of all variables, parameters, and shocks used in the two-country New Keynesian DSGE model. The home economy is the United States (US), and the foreign economy is China (CN).

## I. Endogenous Variables

### Consumption and Labor
- **\( C_t \), \( C_t^* \)**  
  Aggregate consumption in the United States and China, respectively. Consumption is defined as a CES composite of domestically produced and imported goods.

- **\( C_{H,t} \), \( C_{F,t} \)**  
  Consumption of home (US) and foreign (China) goods by US households.

- **\( C_{H,t}^* \), \( C_{F,t}^* \)**  
  Consumption of US and Chinese goods by Chinese households.

- **\( N_t \), \( N_t^* \)**  
  Labor supply in the US and China. Labor is supplied competitively by households and demanded by firms.

---

### Output and Production
- **\( Y_t \), \( Y_t^* \)**  
  Aggregate output (national production) in the US and China.

- **\( Y_t(h) \), \( Y_t^*(f) \)**  
  Output of an individual firm producing differentiated goods in the US and China.

- **\( \bar{Y}_t \), \( \bar{Y}_t^* \)**  
  Natural (flexible-price) level of output in each economy.

- **\( x_t \), \( x_t^* \)**  
  Output gaps, defined as deviations of actual output from natural output.

---

### Prices, Inflation, and Costs
- **\( P_t(h) \), \( P_t(f) \)**  
  Prices of domestically produced and imported goods in the US.

- **\( P_t^*(h) \), \( P_t^*(f) \)**  
  Prices of US and Chinese goods in China.

- **\( \pi_{H,t} \), \( \pi_{F,t}^* \)**  
  Inflation rates in the US and China, defined as log changes in the CPI.

- **\( W_t \), \( W_t^* \)**  
  Nominal wages in the US and China.

- **\( mc_{H,t} \), \( mc_{F,t}^* \)**  
  Real marginal costs faced by firms in the US and China.

---

### Financial Variables and International Prices
- **\( r_t^{US} \)**  
  Nominal policy interest rate set by the Federal Reserve.

- **\( r_t^{CN} \)**  
  Nominal policy interest rate set by the People’s Bank of China.

- **\( s_t \)**  
  Terms of trade, defined as the relative price of foreign goods to home goods.

- **\( e_t \)**  
  Nominal exchange rate (USD/CNY), defined as the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency.

- **\( Q_{t,t+1} \), \( Q_{t,t+1}^* \)**  
  Stochastic discount factors in the US and China.

- **\( D_t^n \), \( D_t^{n,*} \)**  
  Nominal bond holdings of households in the US and China.

---

### Dollarization
- **\( dol_{CN,t} \)**  
  Degree of financial dollarization in China, representing the share of financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency.

---

## II. Exogenous Processes and Shocks

- **\( a_t \), \( a_t^* \)**  
  Productivity shocks in the US and China, following AR(1) processes.

- **\( m_t^{US} \)**  
  US monetary policy shock.

- **\( m_t^{CN} \)**  
  China monetary policy shock.

- **\( \varepsilon_{dol,t} \)**  
  De-dollarization (or dollarization) shock affecting China’s financial system.

---

## III. Structural Parameters

### Preferences
- **\( \beta \)**  
  Subjective discount factor, capturing households’ time preferences.

- **\( \sigma \)**  
  Coefficient of relative risk aversion and inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

- **\( \phi \)**  
  Inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply.

---

### Technology and Market Structure
- **\( \theta \)**  
  Calvo price stickiness parameter, representing the probability that firms cannot adjust prices.

- **\( \epsilon \)**  
  Elasticity of substitution among differentiated goods.

- **\( \kappa \)**  
  Slope of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, determining inflation responsiveness to marginal costs.

---

### Open Economy Parameters
- **\( \alpha \)**  
  Degree of trade openness, measuring the share of imported goods in consumption.

- **\( \eta \)**  
  Elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods.

- **\( \omega_2 \)**  
  Composite parameter capturing trade-related spillovers in the IS equation.

---

### Monetary Policy Rule Parameters
- **\( \rho_{US} \), \( \rho_{CN} \)**  
  Interest rate smoothing parameters for the US and China.

- **\( \phi_{\pi,US} \), \( \phi_{\pi,CN} \)**  
  Monetary policy response coefficients to inflation.

- **\( \phi_{x,US} \), \( \phi_{x,CN} \)**  
  Monetary policy response coefficients to the output gap.

- **\( \delta_{rUS} \)**  
  Spillover coefficient capturing China’s response to US interest rate movements.

- **\( \gamma_{dol} \)**  
  Sensitivity of China’s monetary policy to dollarization pressures.

---

### Dollarization Dynamics
- **\( \rho_{dol} \)**  
  Persistence of the dollarization process.

- **\( \gamma_{\pi} \)**  
  Response of dollarization to domestic inflation in China.

---

## IV. Interpretation Summary

The model combines standard New Keynesian mechanisms with international spillovers and a novel dollarization channel. Dollarization weakens monetary policy transmission in China, requiring stronger policy responses and generating cross-border effects that influence US monetary conditions, inflation, and output.
