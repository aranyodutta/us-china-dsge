# Impulse Response Function (IRF) Notes

This document provides a complete and standardized set of **Impulse Response Function (IRF) notes** for all shocks and variables analyzed in the paper *Monetary Policy and De-Dollarization Dynamics in a Two-Country DSGE Model: Evidence from the US and China*. Each IRF is described using a uniform template to ensure clarity, comparability, and suitability for academic presentation.

## I. US Monetary Policy Shock

### 1. US Monetary Policy Interest Rate
**Variable:** Monetary policy interest rate (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; persists for approximately four to five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
A contractionary monetary policy shock directly raises the policy interest rate through the Taylor rule. Interest rate smoothing causes the effect to persist over several quarters before gradually dissipating.

---

### 2. US Inflation Rate
**Variable:** Inflation rate (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; lasts around three quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs and reduce consumption and investment. The resulting decline in aggregate demand lowers inflation in the short run.

---

### 3. US Marginal Cost
**Variable:** Marginal cost (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; persists for approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Lower inflation and reduced demand decrease input prices and wage pressures. Firms face lower production costs, leading to a decline in real marginal costs.

---

### 4. US National Production
**Variable:** Output / national production (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; lasts about six quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
The contractionary stance reduces aggregate demand through higher interest rates, leading to a prolonged decline in output below its natural level.

---

### 5. Exchange Rate (USD/CNY)
**Variable:** Nominal exchange rate (USD relative to CNY)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Lower US inflation and marginal costs reduce US prices relative to China. This relative price adjustment results in a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate.

---

### 6. China Monetary Policy Interest Rate (Spillover)
**Variable:** Monetary policy interest rate (China)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately four quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
To limit capital outflows and prevent excessive depreciation against the US dollar, the People’s Bank of China raises its policy rate in response to higher US interest rates.

---

### 7. China Inflation Rate (Spillover)
**Variable:** Inflation rate (China)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; around five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
The depreciation of the US dollar improves China’s export competitiveness, boosting production and demand. Increased economic activity generates upward pressure on domestic prices.

---

### 8. China Marginal Cost (Spillover)
**Variable:** Marginal cost (China)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately two quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Rising inflation increases input prices and wages, temporarily raising marginal costs for Chinese firms.

---

### 9. China National Production (Spillover)
**Variable:** Output / national production (China)  
**Shock:** Positive US monetary policy shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately four quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Improved export competitiveness following exchange rate movements raises external demand for Chinese goods, increasing production.

---

## II. China Dollarization Shock

### 10. US Monetary Policy Interest Rate
**Variable:** Monetary policy interest rate (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Higher dollarization in China raises inflationary pressures and interest rates abroad. The Federal Reserve reacts by increasing its policy rate to stabilize domestic conditions.

---

### 11. US Inflation Rate
**Variable:** Inflation rate (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Spillovers from higher global interest rates and tighter financial conditions increase production costs and inflationary pressures in the US economy.

---

### 12. US Marginal Cost
**Variable:** Marginal cost (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Rising inflation translates into higher input prices and wages, increasing marginal production costs.

---

### 13. US National Production
**Variable:** Output / national production (United States)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; around five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Strong external demand and financial spillovers temporarily boost US production.

---

### 14. Exchange Rate (USD/CNY)
**Variable:** Nominal exchange rate (USD relative to CNY)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** No statistically significant response  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Offsetting monetary policy reactions in both countries neutralize exchange rate movements.

---

### 15. China Monetary Policy Interest Rate
**Variable:** Monetary policy interest rate (China)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Positive; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Increased dollarization weakens domestic monetary transmission and generates inflationary pressures. The PBoC raises interest rates more aggressively to reassert control over inflation.

---

### 16. China Inflation Rate
**Variable:** Inflation rate (China)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
The increase in interest rates reduces domestic demand and inflation despite the initial inflationary impulse from dollarization.

---

### 17. China Marginal Cost
**Variable:** Marginal cost (China)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Lower inflation and reduced demand decrease input prices, leading to declining marginal costs.

---

### 18. China National Production
**Variable:** Output / national production (China)  
**Shock:** Positive China dollarization shock  
**Direction & Timing:** Negative; approximately five quarters  
**Economic Intuition:**  
Higher interest rates dampen investment and consumption, resulting in a contraction of economic activity.

---

## Summary

The IRFs reveal strong **international spillovers** and highlight the central role of **financial dollarization** in shaping monetary policy effectiveness. US monetary policy shocks transmit primarily through demand and exchange rate channels, while China dollarization shocks operate through weakened monetary transmission and induce stronger policy responses, with significant domestic and global macroeconomic consequences.
