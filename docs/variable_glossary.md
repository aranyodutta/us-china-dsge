# Variable and Parameter Glossary

This section provides a comprehensive glossary of all variables, parameters, and shocks used in the two-country New Keynesian DSGE model. The home economy is the United States (US), and the foreign economy is China (CN).

## I. Endogenous Variables

### Consumption and Labor

- **$C_t$, $C_t^{*}$**  
  Aggregate consumption in the United States (home economy) and China (foreign economy), respectively. Consumption is defined as a CES composite of domestically produced and imported goods.

- **$C_{H,t}$, $C_{F,t}$**  
  Consumption of home (US) goods and foreign (China) goods by US households.

- **$C_{H,t}^{*}$, $C_{F,t}^{*}$**  
  Consumption of US goods and Chinese goods by Chinese households.

- **$N_t$, $N_t^{*}$**  
  Labor supply in the United States and China. Labor is supplied by households and demanded by firms.

---

### Output and Production

- **$Y_t$, $Y_t^{*}$**  
  Aggregate output (national production) in the United States and China.

- **$Y_t(h)$, $Y_t^{*}(f)$**  
  Output of an individual firm producing differentiated goods in the United States and China.

- **$\bar{Y}_t$, $\bar{Y}_t^{*}$**  
  Natural (flexible-price) level of output in each economy.

- **$x_t$, $x_t^{*}$**  
  Output gaps, defined as the deviation of actual output from natural output.

---

### Prices, Inflation, and Costs

- **$P_t(h)$, $P_t(f)$**  
  Prices of domestically produced and imported goods in the United States.

- **$P_t^{*}(h)$, $P_t^{*}(f)$**  
  Prices of US and Chinese goods in China.

- **$\pi_{H,t}$, $\pi_{F,t}^{*}$**  
  Inflation rates in the United States and China, defined as log changes in the consumer price index.

- **$W_t$, $W_t^{*}$**  
  Nominal wages in the United States and China.

- **$mc_{H,t}$, $mc_{F,t}^{*}$**  
  Real marginal costs faced by firms in the United States and China.

---

### Financial Variables and International Prices

- **$r_t^{US}$**  
  Nominal policy interest rate set by the Federal Reserve.

- **$r_t^{CN}$**  
  Nominal policy interest rate set by the People’s Bank of China.

- **$s_t$**  
  Terms of trade, defined as the relative price of foreign goods to home goods.

- **$e_t$**  
  Nominal exchange rate (USD/CNY), defined as the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency.

- **$Q_{t,t+1}$, $Q_{t,t+1}^{*}$**  
  Stochastic discount factors in the United States and China.

- **$D_t^{n}$, $D_t^{n,*}$**  
  Nominal bond holdings of households in the United States and China.

---

### Dollarization

- **$dol_{CN,t}$**  
  Degree of financial dollarization in China, representing the share of financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency.

---

## II. Exogenous Processes and Shocks

- **$a_t$, $a_t^{*}$**  
  Productivity shocks in the United States and China, following autoregressive processes.

- **$m_t^{US}$**  
  US monetary policy shock.

- **$m_t^{CN}$**  
  China monetary policy shock.

- **$\varepsilon_{dol,t}$**  
  De-dollarization (or dollarization) shock affecting China’s financial system.

---

## III. Structural Parameters

### Preferences

- **$\beta$**  
  Subjective discount factor, capturing households’ time preferences.

- **$\sigma$**  
  Coefficient of relative risk aversion and inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

- **$\phi$**  
  Inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply.

---

### Technology and Market Structure

- **$\theta$**  
  Calvo price stickiness parameter, representing the probability that firms cannot adjust prices in a given period.

- **$\varepsilon$**  
  Elasticity of substitution among differentiated goods.

- **$\kappa$**  
  Slope of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, determining the sensitivity of inflation to marginal costs.

---

### Open Economy Parameters

- **$\alpha$**  
  Degree of trade openness, measuring the share of imported goods in total consumption.

- **$\eta$**  
  Elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods.

- **$\omega_2$**  
  Composite parameter capturing trade-related spillovers in the IS equation.

---

### Monetary Policy Rule Parameters

- **$\rho_{US}$, $\rho_{CN}$**  
  Interest rate smoothing parameters for the United States and China.

- **$\phi_{\pi,US}$, $\phi_{\pi,CN}$**  
  Monetary policy response coefficients to inflation.

- **$\phi_{x,US}$, $\phi_{x,CN}$**  
  Monetary policy response coefficients to the output gap.

- **$\delta_{rUS}$**  
  Spillover coefficient capturing China’s response to movements in the US policy interest rate.

- **$\gamma_{dol}$**  
  Sensitivity of China’s monetary policy to dollarization pressures.

---

### Dollarization Dynamics

- **$\rho_{dol}$**  
  Persistence parameter governing the evolution of dollarization in China.

- **$\gamma_{\pi}$**  
  Response of dollarization to domestic inflation in China.

---

## IV. Interpretation Summary

The model combines standard New Keynesian mechanisms with international spillovers and a dollarization channel. Financial dollarization weakens monetary policy transmission in China, requiring stronger interest rate responses and generating significant cross-border effects on inflation, output, and monetary policy in the United States.
